## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
alloy <- read.csv("alloy.csv",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
mean(alloy[,1])
sd(alloy[,1])

#find mean of strength where alloy is 1
mean(alloy[alloy$alloy == 1,1])

t.test(alloy[alloy$alloy==1,1],alloy[alloy$alloy==2,1],"two.sided")
t.test(alloy[alloy$alloy==1,1],alloy[alloy$alloy==2,1],"two.sided",var.equal = TRUE)


```

```{r}
x <- c(3,4,5,6)
y <- c(5,7,8,12)

dat <- data.frame(x,y)

dat$x+1
as.character(dat$x)
log(dat$x)
exp(dat$x)
#as.character(dat$x)+1  Doesn't work because you can't add one to a character
                
```
```{r}
pnorm(1.353)
qnorm(.909)
#qnorm gives you the z score for a given p value, pnorm does the opposite

pt(1.335,12)
qt(.897,12)
```
```{r}
rnvals <- rnorm(100,6,3)
mean(rnvals)
sd(rnvals)
#not exact since it created a sample of a normal distribution

hist(rnvals)
boxplot(rnvals)
```
```{r}
x <- runif(15,0,10)
y <- 1.2*x + 3 + rnorm(12,0,4)
pl <- plot(x,y)
pl


xy = data.frame(x,y)
lm.xy <- lm(xy[,2]~xy[,1])
summary(lm.xy)
coef(lm.xy)
plot(xy)
abline(lm.xy, col="blue")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
